**Instructor**: John Simpson

**Description**: Most introductions to a command line interface are targeted at using the interface as a gateway to some
  other tool that it doesn't make sense to access in any other way.  This workshop will be different because it will
  introduce you to using the command line interface to actually do work directly on the command line.  Why would anyone
  want to do this you ask?  In many cases the command line is faster and offers abilities that other tools do not,
  especially when working with raw text files.  This will be a hands-on workshop that assumes no previous knowledge.
  While a very specific use-case will be considered throughout the point of the workshop will be to highlight possible
  future applications that participants might be interested in.
