**Description**: In this session, we will give an overview of what a cloud is generally, as well as the Compute Canada
  Federation cloud specifically. To demonstrate what may be accomplished with a cloud, different cloud usage cases for
  the Humanities and Social Sciences will be presented followed by a discussion of two common methods for website
  generation, a common use for the cloud. We will finish with a brief discussion of server security and the implications
  it has for the two methods presented for creating websites.
