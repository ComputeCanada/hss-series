**Description**: Research Data Management (RDM) is increasingly recognized as a key aspect in the research
  lifecycle. With the upcoming release of the Tri-Agencies’ Policy on Research Data Management, it is becoming
  progressively more important for researchers to have an understanding of RDM fundamentals. Beyond the implications of
  the Policy, the fundamentals of RDM make for better research practices, and are meant to save researchers time and
  headache caused by unforeseen circumstances. This workshop will begin with an overview of RDM, and will then delve
  into a Data Management Plan template specifically geared toward humanities and social sciences research. We’ll walk
  through the DMP and discuss questions that arise in these research fields, and will wrap-up by looking at some
  resources and tools to help support the management of your data.
