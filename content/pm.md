**Instructor**: Megan Lobay

**Description**: So, you want to do a DH project? In this session, I will outline DH project management best practices
  and introducte resources for researchers wanting to get started.  As Digital Humanities is a highly interdisciplinary
  field, projects almost always involved experts across many different fields, departments, campuses, and sometimes
  countries. Planning how all thes people will work together throughout the life of the project is crucial to its
  success. This session will include introductions to the many invaluable resources out there for researchers as well as
  some hands on exercises in thinking through your projects.
